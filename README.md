2. **Airbnb**

3. **DuckDuckGo Search**

## Package Management

This project uses `uv` instead of `pip` for faster and more efficient Python package management. UV is a modern Python package installer and resolver.

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages using uv:
   ```bash
   uv add mcp-use
   uv add langchain-groq
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   uv run app.py
   ```

## Basic Commands

- Type "open Google" to open Google in a browser
- Search for hotels by typing "find hotels in [city name]"
- Type "bye" to exit the program

## Note
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer before running the project.

That's it! Enjoy using the chatbot! ðŸ˜Š
